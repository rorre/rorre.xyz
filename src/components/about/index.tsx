          I am an undergraduate Computer Science student with interest in
          various Web Development and Software Engineering technologies. I also
          have interest in the world of Data Science. I have used a few common
          technologies used in the world, such as Next.js, Strapi, and Redis.
          However I also like to experiment with new technologies, such as
          Starlette as I strive for new experience.

          I have started programming ever since middle school, but never got
          into it seriously until my 2nd year of high school. From there, I have
          made various web applications, some of which are available in the
          Works section below.

          I am always open for new environment, and I am fairly adept into new
          environment. This includes adapting to pre-existing codebase and flow
          as I try to match into the standards as much as possible.
